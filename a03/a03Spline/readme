This Xcode project draws a control point with each touch event. As soon as there are 3n+1 ccontrol points, it draws n Bezier Splines. 
It also the point proximity test, so if the touch is in proximity of an existing control point, it grabs (and moves) tha control point. If not, it will add a new control point.
